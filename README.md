1. Introduction

In this lab warmup, you will take a quick tour using the Verilog tools that we will use in this class, and what it takes to run them by hand. You will then construct a simple digital design in Verilog. By the end of this warmup, you should be familiar with MGC ModelSim for basic simulation and for viewing the output of ModelSim. The laboratory is really meant to be an easy-to-follow process of how to implement a design on a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA).

This laboratory albeit simple is meant to familiarize yourself with the methodology in which we design, validate and implement devices on our Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) on the National Instruments DSDB board. Therefore, it is important to ask questions and learn as much as you can about the process. As we progress further throughout the semester, labs will get progressively more di cult, so learn as much as you can with this introductory laboratory.

1.1 Simulation

Simulation is key to making sure your hardware for any architecture or digital system works. It is often the di erence between something that works and something that is a pure speculation. Therefore, it is vital that for lab that you understand well how to simulate and get results from ModelSim.

Although there are books and books out there on the subject, it is best understood by someone who has been trained properly in the area. It is also important you follow the right procedure which is summarized as follows:

1. Design the idea in Verilog to model as close as possible the implementation you wish to try.

2. It is important you try to create the Hardware Descriptive Language (HDL) as close as possible to thenal logic you wish to implement. When you write HDL, it is not coding or software programming it is modeling hardware. The closer you make the HDL to the logic you wish to implement, the easier it will be for the synthesizer to complete the design.

3. Write a testbench that will test your HDL you wish to test with known or golden vectors.

4. Run the simulation with a script or DO (Tcl) le so that others can repeat the design if you wish.

5. Although exhaustive simulation of your design is desirable, it is most often impossible; therefore, testas many vectors as you can until the design works as properly. If the design fails at any step, go back and test the lower-level hierarchy, if needed, to make sure it is working properly.

6. After your design veri es through a testbench, implement your design on a FPGA.

Mentor Graphics (MGC) ModelSim is a popular Hardware Descriptive Language (HDL) compiler and simulator that is widely used in the industry. Although there are similar tools form other vendors (e.g., Synopsys VCS or Cadence Design Systems NCsim), the ideas are rather similar between Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools. Regardless of the choice of simulator, the use of testbenches and batch les to invoke simulation are the staple of digital designers and architects.

Testbenches are essential to HDL designs and they are not unique to simulators. They are part of the Verilog standard and are typically written in a behavioral manner to make sure your simulation essentially works. Although many testbenches are utilized, using a testbench that veri es what the true result should be is essential. Therefore, it is encouraged that you utilize a self-checking style in your testbench. Although testbenches are usually written by the architecture, this part of the lab a sample testbench is provided to you.

The next part of the simulation environment is called a DO le and is basically a batch le for ModelSim that allows the simulation to run regardless of a users set up. A sample DO le is given to you, but you should modify to make sure it runs your nite state machine design and its appropriate testbench. To run ModelSim with a DO le, type the following command at a command prompt.

vsim -do file.do

2. Full Adder Cell

In the main part of this lab, you will construct a 1-bit full adder design using a Sum of Products (SOP) form. This circuit outputs a 1-bit sum and a 1-bit carry out for its input a, b, and cin. The full adder is one of the more popular pieces of digital logic that is utilized in most digital systems today. This laboratory is really simple and meant to get you to go through the process of understanding what is needed to implement the design on a FPGA.

Often we start with a truth table that shows the output value for each input combination. For an n-input function, a truth table has 2n rows (8 in this case), one for each input combination. Each row lists the output of the circuit for that input combination (0 or 1 for a one-bit output). The Boolean logic for the generation of an output indicating the sum and carry out of your 3-bit (i.e., a, b, and cin) input. To help you with the design and getting started, here is the following Boolean logic that produces the correct answer. However, it is advisable to create a truth table of your inputs and outputs so you can check whether your design works later in the laboratory.

sum = a âŠ• b âŠ• cin

cout = a Â· b + a Â· cin + b Â· cin

2.1 Requirements

2.2 HDL Creation and Simulation

Go ahead and write a Hardware Description (HDL) module with the speci cation given above, and build a testbench for your register le. In order to help you get started, your repository should have an empty HDL le that is missing some pieces. However, it should have the ports to help you gure out what is an input or output. There is an abundant amount of information in Chapter 4 in your textbook [1] including some information on creating the HDL for the full adder.

A testbench is another form of a HDL that is used to make sure your design is designed correctly. It basically tests all possible cases against your design, typically called a designundertest or dut. You should examine the sample silly testbench and use this to create a testbench for your full adder. More information is discussed on testbenches in your textbook in Section 4.9 and discussed heavily in class. Fortunately, you will use a simple testbench for this laboratory and we will use subsequent labs to understand more complex testbenches.

Ensure that you test all reasonable cases (e.g., 8 possible values) before you implement the design in a FPGA. Use the waveform viewer in ModelSim in order to examine the behavior of your design. You should use modify the testbench and DO le to help you verify your design properly.

2.3 Synthesis and Implementation

As explained in class, when you synthesize a design it converts your HDL from a known working piece of digital logic into one in which can be implemented on the FPGA board. We will use the Digital System Development Board or DSDB board that inserts into the National Instruments (NI) ELVIS-III board. This DSDB board contains an advanced FPGA with many features that we will not fully utilize, however, it will still be able to utilize all the features we require for our laboratories.

Another important note here is that before you begin the implementation, your design should work without a hitch in simulation. Therefore, it is important to have your working version of Verilog before you try to implement anything. Do not waste time implementing your design on the FPGA until it completely works in simulation. If for some reason, your design does not work, it will be sure to not work in the FPGA.

For the synthesis and place &amp; route portions of the design ow, we will use a tool called Vivado produced by Xilinx. It should be located on your desktop or through the application menu. The goal at the end of the day is to have the FPGA be assembled into a real, live system. You start by writing Verilog and integrating IP and the result is a bit le which gets loaded onto the FPGA and con gures all of its internal interconnects to implement your design. Starting with correct code, this entire process can take anywhere from a few minutes to hours depending on the complexity of the design. All builds are broken into three main steps:

2.3.1 Synthesis

Generally, this is pretty quick (except for initial rst-time). In this step the System Verilog and other content (including block diagram IP, interconnects, etc) are interpreted and built into a synthesizable system that can be simulated (if desired). Synthesis is where syntax issues in your SystemVerilog are caught as well as blatant connection con icts or things like combinatorial loops (cases where a logic gate drives itself with no ip- ops/latches in between). Synthesis does not look into timing restrictions or how a particular line will get turned into an actual constructed device using resources on the chip. That is usually determined in the next step, Implementation.

2.3.2 Implementation

This is where the bulk of a build cycle will be spent. In this step, the successfully-synthesized project (previous step) will be laid out using the on-chip resources of the FPGA. It is an iterative process which tries to optimize many variables in order to t it on the chip. Small designs can be implemented quickly, but larger designs will take longer. The larger a design is relative to the resources on a chip, the longer the implementation step will take since it has less breathing room. Implementation will provide a resource-level view of your entire design (down to the individual Lookup tables (LUTs) in the design as well as show where everything is laid out on the chip). Timing information will also be provided and timing violations (e.g., violation of setup and hold requirements) will be indicated here.

2.3.3 Bitstream

Usually, this is quick after the slog of the Implementation. Here the implementation results from the previous step are converted into a binary le that can be loaded into the FPGA and used to set up its internal circuitry correctly. In this lab, you will be using the Digital System Development Board (DSDB) on an NI ELVIS-III workstation. The DSDB contains a ZYNQ XC7Z020CLG484-1 FPGA. In Vivado, set the family to Zynq-7000.

The quickest step by far is programming the device. This will take a few seconds and pipes the binary le of the previous step onto the FPGA as well as triggers a few restart/con guration pins to make it automatically load. These few seconds are the best seconds of your life. Youâ€™ve successfully gotten a design through all the steps, but it has not yet let you down by not working. Savor them. It doesnâ€™t get any better than this.

3. What to design?

As explained previously, you will be using the DSDB board. The DSDB board contains our Xilinx Zynq FPGA (Item 18 in Figure 1) as well as other elements to help you debug what is going on. The diagram of

Port Type Description

sw[3:0] Input push buttons (#23)

btn[7:0] Input SPDT slide switches (#24)

led[7:0] Output Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) (#22)

Table 1: Ports Used for Lab 0

the design is shown in Figure 1. For this laboratory, you will use the slide switches (Item 24 in Figure 1) to select the inputs and the LEDs on board (Item 22 in Figure 1) to see if your design works properly. Since there are only 3 inputs, you could test each possible combination of inputs to see if it matches your truth table.

The eight high-e ciency LEDs are anode-connected to the Zynq via 330 â„¦ resistors, so they will turn on when a logic high voltage is applied to their respective I/O pin. A schematic is given of the DSDB board on Canvas for those that are interested. Additional LEDs that are not user-accessible indicate power-on (PGOOD), FPGA programming status (DONE), and USB and Ethernet port status.

You should use the following items for your ports in your top-level module as shown in Table 1. You do not have to use all of the items, but they are there to use for inputs, outputs, or debugging. You should also test your design so it works for all 8 combinations of inputs.

3.1 How to get started?

To get you started there are a couple of downloads that will help you get started. All of these les are found within a zip le on Canvas called lab0.zip. The rst item is a complete SV le, testbench and DO le you can use as a template for your test. Second, there is a zip le of a demo program. The demo program does not have anything in it except a blank SV le that you should modify. Feel free to modify the le name or module name, if you wish, as well.

The included complete silly.sv SV HDL le is just a sample Verilog le that implements a silly Boolean function (i.e., the same SV HDL le found in Chapter 4 of your textbook [1]). A DO or Tcl le is a script that simulates your design through ModelSim. To simulate your silly.sv, go to a terminal and type: vsim -do silly.do

You should use these les, once you understand how to simulate something, to build the required Verilog le for this laboratory (i.e., the full adder circuit).

Once you design your SV of your full adder and test it thoroughly, implement it on the FPGA board. It is important that your design work in simulation before you even go to implementing on your FPGA board. This should be fairly easy if you use the demo program (i.e., zipped le) to insert your le into the

Figure 1: The NI Digital System Development Board [2]

Figure 2: The top_demo opened project inside Xilinx Vivado

design. That is, once inside Vivado, open the unzipped le by navigating through File-&gt;Project-&gt;Open and opening the Demo.xpr project. Once the project has opened, go to the top_demo.sv source by doubleclicking the top_demo design. It should look like Figure 2 and you can now replace your ModelSim-tested HDL into the top_demo SV le. You can either copy your working HDL into the top_demo SV le or instantiate your full adder as discussed in class. Once inserted, then synthesize and implement your design. Synthesizing and implementing your design on the FPGA normally takes several minutes and so this is why we spend so much time designing our HDL before we get to this step.

The Xilinx Vivado software is very complex and its going to take a while to understand how to get more complicated designs through. For now, rst make sure your SV completes the test correctly (i.e., through all 8 combinations in ModelSim). Then, when inside Vivado, click the following on the left-hand sidebar to start the process of implementing onto the FPGA.

1. Run Synthesis

2. Run Implementation

3. Generate Bitstream

This should take a little bit of time, but once complete, the design should be ready to download to the board.

To download to the board, click Open Hardware Manager on the left-hand sidebar and then you can either click Program Device on the left-hand sidebar or at the top of the screen. Once implemented, the device should be running. Then, use the LEDs and buttons to test your design to see if it works as your simulation did. You can also, if needed, print out a schematic of your design by clicking the Schematic option under the RTL Anlaysis section on the left-hand sidebar.

As we learned in class, comnbinations is a selection of items from a collection. You only have two options per input, which amounts to 23 = 8 possible combinations of inputs. Make a table of all 8 possible input combinations and their respective output for the implementation using the LEDs to help debug what is going on. You should keep a record of this testing to make sure things worked as expected. The output should match the testing you saw in your ModelSim simulation. That is, you should test the 8 possible input combinations in ModelSim and in the implementation on the FPGA. Both versions of testing should match indicating your design worked as indicated.

Figure 3: Implementation Window on Xilinxâ€™s Vivado

3.2 FPGA Implementation

You should also skim the document [3] and understand the di erences between what an ASIC and a FPGA is. This document is also on Canvas, so you should download and read it lightly, paying special attention to Section II wihin the paper. Both ASICs and FPGAs are extremely similar in their structure, but can be di erent in terms of their implementation. However, they both use HDLs and using the methodology discussed in class bene ts both implementations. Inside your lab report, you should indicate why FPGAs are important and how they can be utilized to implement digital gates e ciently.

3.2.1 Power, Performance and Area (PPA)

Digital systems typically employ outputs that indicate statistics of how much space and time is consumed on a device. These are typically alotted into an analysis called Power, Performance and Area (PPA) analysis. You should document in your report how much PPA is utilized for your nal design.

For future laboratories, we will explore the PPA of your design, but for this lab you should only report your nal area for your nal design. The area for the Xilinx FPGA is reported in slices utilized. You can nd this information by Open Implemented Design on the left side of the screen and then clicking the Report Utilization tab, as seen in Figure 3. This should produce output that gives the total number of slices used for your design. Interestingly, you can also look at the Schematic it produces by clicking the Schematic option on the Open Implemented Design tab. For these laboratories, you should just report the total Slices for your LUTs which you can nd in the Summary part of the Utilization Report. LUTs are the look-up tables discussed in [3].

4. Handin

You should electronically hand in your HDL (all les that you want us to see) into Canvas. You should also take a printout of your waveform from your ModelSim simulation. Only one of your team members should upload the les and/or lab report. Although we only need one lab report, each team member should upload their team assessment form. You can upload them together or separately; to get credit for the laboratory, we must receive this team assessment. Your code should be readable and well-documented. In addition, please turn in additional test cases or any other added item that you used. Please also remember to document everything in your Lab Report using the information found in the Grading Rubric.
